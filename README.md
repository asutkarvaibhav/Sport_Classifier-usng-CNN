# Sport_Classifier-usng-CNN

**This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification model that classifies images into different sports categories. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, this model demonstrates a fundamental application of deep learning in the field of computer vision.**

**📁 Project Structure**  
* sport-classifier-using-cnn-vaibhav.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the full code for loading the dataset, preprocessing, building the CNN model, training, evaluation, and predictions.

**🚀 Features**  
* Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
* Real-time image preprocessing and augmentation
* Evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics
* Visualizations of training and validation performance

**🧠 Model Architecture**  
The CNN model includes:  
* Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation
* MaxPooling Layers
* Flatten and Dense layers
* Dropout for regularization
* Softmax output layer for classification

**🗂 Dataset**  
The model uses a custom image dataset consisting of sports images categorized into different folders (e.g., Cricket, Football, Tennis, etc.). Make sure your dataset directory structure is:  
dataset/
  ├── cricket/
  ├── football/
  ├── tennis/
  └── ...
